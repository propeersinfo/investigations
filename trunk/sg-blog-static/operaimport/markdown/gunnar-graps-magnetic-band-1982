Two very funky tracks from a very eclectic LP C60-17019-20 (Roosid papale/Розы для папы) containing also blues, rock'n'roll, Jethro Tull-rock, heavy metal, pop reggae and ambient! That is a kind of compilation so 1982 is the year of the release only.

I just haven't thought there were so many groove in USSR when started the blog (:

[gunnar graps - leidmine 1982.mp3]  (1:56 is the peak)

[gunnar graps - odusseuse eksirannakud 1982.mp3] 

Full LP rip is still <a href="http://progresyvusisrokas.blogspot.com/2009/03/gunnar-graps-magnetic-band-est-roosid.html">available</a> where I have taken it from.
