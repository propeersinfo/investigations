A famous soviet composer <a href="/tag/tukhmanov.html">David Tukhmanov</a> has wrote this conceptual LP (rare case these days) called something like "By the wave of my memory" where he used only lyrics of poets of the past. It gained a large popularity in USSR despite it was made in non quite popular styles  of music such as art-rock and funk a bit, as the first track (sung by Alexander Lerman) shows:

[david tukhmanov - herz mein herz 1975.mp3]  / Сердце моё сердце

The next track has just beautifulest female vocals by Lyudmila Barykina and it is very expressive too:

[david tukhmanov - confusion 1975.mp3]  / Смятение

I don't think I could wonder somebody russian with the release (<a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/8842571/david_tukhmanov_po_volne.rar">download it</a>) but it's a classics stuff anyway and the music remains cool. There were days I used to listen to that LP every day when discovered it in grandma's flat :)
