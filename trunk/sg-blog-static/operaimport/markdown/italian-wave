Alexander Zatsepin's track “Sochi” from russian movie “Ни слова о футболе” (no imdb entry) of 1973. It's full of that unique italian sound men like Umiliani, Piccioni, Morricone & Trovaioli did in 60s. 5-7  years later, yes, but it's perfect!

I watched that movie a bit: there is a fashion show broadcasted in TV with this music. I'm very glad someone has released it in 2003 finally because the recording is hardly audible in the film.
