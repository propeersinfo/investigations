<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133154/">Hijacking of Savoy</a> (Похищение Савойи) — an adventure movie of 1979. 39 millions had watched it in Soviet Union; I watched it too — it's a good genre movie. Composer Andrzej Koszinski has wrote several quite different themes.

Disco — it's praised and advertised the city of Rio there:

Surely, there is a romantic episode in the film that: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EroHm-F0Ls8. Reminds me the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf1Vt6r-sj8">main theme</a> from Cannibal Holocaust by Riz Ortolani by its mood.

There is all what people expects to see in an exploitation adventure move: crime, exotics, jungle, chases, nazis, erotics and even a bit of nuns :-)). It reminds me works of euro directors like Rugero Deodato: Cannibal Holocaust and Concorde Affaire (released the same year).
