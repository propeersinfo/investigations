I know almost nothing about this band, except Irina Allegrova — a pop star of the 90's — used to work there 1976-1977. Here is a powerful & rhythmic pop track from their first EP:

[vdokhnovenie - nasha pesnya 1976.mp3]  / Наша песня

And a real psychedelic gem with music written by the artistic director of the collective, Valentina Ivanova:

[vdokhnovenie - vodopad 1976.mp3]  / Водопад
