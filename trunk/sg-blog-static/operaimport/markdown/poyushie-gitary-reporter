Alexander Kolker wrote this beat music for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061907/">a movie</a> of 1967. His wife - Maria Pakhomenko - performed a song brilliantly. The rest is by Saint-Petersburg's band “Poyushie Gitary”. It has been released on vinyl hardly and I am not aware about the tracks' source.

Despite its poor quality I love that beat track - enjoy the vocal and instrumental versions.
