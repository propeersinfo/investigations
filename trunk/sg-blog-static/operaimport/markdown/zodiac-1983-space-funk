I don't mind why there is so many <a href="/tag/latvia.html">latvian groovers</a> and none from neighbouring Lithuania & Estonia, but here latvians comes again — The Zodiac band with their space funk. The track is an example of excellent sound producer's work and has clear sound that's a rare case for the year of 1983.

Full LP download is available at http://skameikin.blogspot.com/2009/10/1982_12.html but you will not find any funk there as well as on other their albums — only space eletronic instrumentals.
