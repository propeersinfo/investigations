There is interesting titles music by Boris Rychkov (Борис Рычков). The movie itself (Star Inspector) reminds me “Planet of Vampires” by Mario Bava.

It also reminds me <a href="/a-dear-boy-1974-part-1.html">A dear boy</a>: 1) similar special effects, 2) a song about the Earth in the end accompanied by 3) running horses and children.
