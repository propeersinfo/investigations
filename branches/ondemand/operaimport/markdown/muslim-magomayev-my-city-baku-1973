A funk act by very popular soviet singer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Magomayev_(musician)">Muslim Magomayev</a>. The noteables are intro & strongness of his vocals, although I like the song entirely.

33СМ-04387 * 1973 * LP Песни Полада Бюль-Бюль оглы

Author of music is well known composer Polad Bülbüloğlu (who is currently ambassador of the Republic of Azerbaijan to the Russian Federation). I suppose, it's not the least his apperance in the blog. The lyrics praises the city of Baku (Azerbaijan).
