It looks like this man made exactly one groovie track on each his release. No more, no less :-) Now here is an excerption from a 27-minutes track of his LP "And the wood has awaken". There are three parts and they sounds like library music of 80s: Brian Bennett... The first part sounds like a drum'n'bass track too... without drums however—is there a drummer to play his drum line over the track?
