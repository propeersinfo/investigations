A live act at the “American Idol”-alike show '1971.

Good band played many musical styles: beat, art-rock, folklore arrangements, then pop. But just several their songs fits the blog's content — even just one maybe (-:

The 1st song is characterized by crrrazy powerful2 breakbeat. Unfortunately internet knows nothing about it although the band itself is well known.

Another one... I just like it very much (-:
