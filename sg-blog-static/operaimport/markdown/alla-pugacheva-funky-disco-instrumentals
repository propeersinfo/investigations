A powerfull funk instrumental from 'A woman than sings' movie of 1978 (Женщина которая поёт). This is played by the 'Rhythm' group conducted by A. Avilov that has accompanied Alla Pugechova — a music queen of Russia — these times.

Two years later the same group released LP «Discotheque A» consisting of funky/disco instrumental versions of Pucgacheva's songs. They play it continuously — just like DJ's do. Not so heavy as the previous track but it is very interesting groovy stuff anyway.
