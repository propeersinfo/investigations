Several cool orchestra grooves (the first is very strong) from a retro soviet movie about aliens coming on the Earth. It's seems to be played by Garanyan orchestra and written probably by David Tukhmanov. Although it's just a proposal... Musical editor of that movie with last name "M. Blank" is a cool man (or woman?) has offered many groovers to the soviet movie scene like "Nu pogodi" cartoon series. Surely all this get missed from official OST LP :-)
