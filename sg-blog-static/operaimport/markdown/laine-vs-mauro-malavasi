Another video pair. This first one is Laine - "Lõpulaul" (Song of End) with "that wonderful middle-part or breakdown with great percussion sound, something so unbelievable for Soviet Estonian record". Released on the 1983 LP C60-18905-6 ~> http://heliplaadistuudio.blogspot.com/2010/10/wave.html . Another one is the original [Walking On Music] ~> http://www.discogs.com/Peter-Jacques-Band-Fire-Night-Dance/master/13869 written by Mauro﻿ Malavasi and performed by Peter Jacques Band. Again we could have some fun with the Eesti dancing.
