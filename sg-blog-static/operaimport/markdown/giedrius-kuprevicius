<blockquote>“In 1974 a musical „Ugnies medziokle su varovais“ by composer Giedrius Kuprevicius, librettos by Saulius Saltenis and Liudas Jacinevicius, was presented to the audience. Theatre critics appreciated this musical as the first lithuanian musical. This musical was a natural answer to the aesthetical and spiritual needs of then youths, discussing unquestioned statements of the soviet ideology.</blockquote>

<blockquote>According to the musical author Giedrius Kuprevicius „Ugnies medziokle su varovais“ can be called the first rock music work of main form which was accepted by soviet government – always suspicious about novelties; and of course rock music and musical genre associated with propagandizing hippy movement of individual freedom, pacifism and disdain of regime.</blockquote>

Below are several most impressive tracks by my taste. Full LP rip of excellent sound quality is available at the <a href="http://progresyvusisrokas.blogspot.com/2010/02/giedrius-kuprevicius-ltu-fire-hunt-1975.html">Obscure Little Beasties blog</a>. I'd also admit this is the first post about lietuviškai music in the blog among many baltic releases.
