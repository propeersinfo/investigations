There was a well known collective “Vitamiin” playing rather light music in the soviet Estonia. “Uus Generatsioon” (New Generation) band is exactly “Vitamiin” by its staff but performing quite different music — high standard funky and progressive instrumentals.

I didn't know these records was ever released officially — there is no a trail of it. This collection was brought to me by a kind person and it's rare. Also it sounds really good especially for a non-released record. I don't know how it all came but anyway this collection is a must have for groove/progressive music lovers. Tagging it as best.
