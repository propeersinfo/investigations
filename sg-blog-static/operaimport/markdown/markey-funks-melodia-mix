Markey Funk — an Israeli DJ — made a mix full of soviet vinyl. It covers jazz, jazz-rock & fusion. Personally I don't like that kind of music much but it's a good chance for everyone to review soviet jazz scene.

Enjoy the second track from the playlist — I just can't keep myself from stealing it for the blog :-) Check out 4:38 especially — it's a storm!
