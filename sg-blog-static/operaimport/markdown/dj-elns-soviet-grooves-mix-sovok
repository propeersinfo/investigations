A man called ELN from the city of Нижний Новгород made a 30 min mix of hard soviet grooves. The content is rare and strong unlike many other “soviet” works and it's well mixed from vinyls also.

P.S. I have my home computer broken so there are signigicant delays between the posts. I hope to fix it soon buying a new laptop which all are fucking 16:9 formatted unfortunately.
