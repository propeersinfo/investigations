I have dig out some semi-profit stuff so I'm  putting it here all together. Each track is very interesting nevertheless:

1) Extremely beautiful female vocals and a special quiet mood.
2) Raw garage stuff; 70's I believe.
3) Just listen to the beat! Samplers go-go-go!!
4) Incredibly minimalistic electric arrangement; the composition itself is beautiful too; the most end of the 80's I believe.
5) Another beautiful song recorded ~1985 by an <a href="/tag/kalnins.html">Imants Kalnins</a>' band.
