I have just dig out a great find from my hard drive — two short mixes DJ Jankie made  some time ago. They are full of soviet vinyl samples (I posted some of them here). There are scratches, drum loops put over 70s/80s stuff — everything is made with the skill. They are eclectic also — like Coldcut's ones — some samples lasts just several seconds and then the next part begins.
