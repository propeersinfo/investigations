LP Сама жизнь
By <a href="/tag/gradsky.html">Александр Градский</a> и группа “Скоморохи”
Recorded 1981, released 1984 at Мелодия C60 21435 000

It's a vocal suite composed on lyrics of Paul Eluard. A good album and I like the lyrics too, but there is even a cool semi-progrock/semi-electronica instrumental thing on it entitled just as two bang signs.
