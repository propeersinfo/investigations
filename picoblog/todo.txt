Check list:
* make sure admin links are viewable and accessible for admin only

User Testing:
- admin: ability to approve links in a comment
- import: clean <p>'s "style" attr: http://2.sovietraregroove.appspot.com/dj-yan-shrimp-jazzy-tunes-podcast
- after '&' was used in a comment, instead '&amp;' appears in the cookie
- scroll to new added comment
- fix error when submitting empty comment (server side)
- an user commented url is suprisingly clickable at http://2.sovietraregroove.appspot.com/dos-mukasan-1976

Critical:

Major (1.0 stoppers):
- import: parse 'tracklisting:' into '#tracks'
? cache: handle If-Modified-Since?
? markup: rewrite [tag] handling to regex callbacks (upd: this improvement is ineffective it seems)
+ 'new comment' form, if not filled properly, leads to inappropriate stack trace
+ consider storing main slug in Article objects and additional slugs in a special table of redirects
+ install uservoice.com widget
+ not accessible: http://www.sovietgroove.com/robots.txt
+ caching: object (comment/article) removal must affect DataStoreMeta
+ bug: it's needed to obtain preferred language from JavaScript (because of the caching)
+ bug: add an article with slug existing, after an error the '/' will be not accessible (error 500)
+ cache: invalidate HtmlCache entries if db was updated
+ cache: invalidate cache entries created by previous version of the app
+ make 'beta' notification
+ import: implement "add one article from myopera directly"
+ disallow non-admins to view draft articles by urls both "/slug" and "/article/1234"
+ cache pre-rendered pages + front pages + archive
+ do just a redirect in handler of "/article/1234"
+ cache: disable cache read/write for user=admin
+ slugs starting with digits interfere with the article-by-id handler
+ fix "<guid>http://localhost:80/20120209.html</guid>" in RSS
+ http://localhost/1985 not found
+ implement never-expire static resources
+ find how to copy dev db onto production completely

Normal:
- cache etags in memcache?
- impl google search
- impl google analytics
- find all dead links (at least once)
- track external links followed (by JS)
- disallow slugs like "tag", "admin", "page2", "rss"
- auto-translit tracklists by JavaScript
+ un-highlight some links - prev/next, tag links, '5 comments' - because if normal they make a mess
- '/rss' is incompatible with greader (but it's ok with feedburner)
- impl subscription by email
? cache: try not to fetch heavy HtmlCache.html property if etag is matched (find how)
- cache: limit size of HtmlCache somehow
- playlist player not working http://localhost/strange-things
- [dewplaylist] not handled: http://localhost/20100330-the-last-portion-of-qaya.html

- custom mp3 tag: eliminate dirs like "other/gradsky-71âˆ’74-sampler.mp3"
- copy Dropbox images to GAE DB
- new player
- RSS icon
- pagination in comments?

+ import: mixcloud not recognized for http://localhost/ukrainian-groove-part-1
+ soundcloud widgets not imported - http://localhost/a-light-groovy-disco-compilation-by-schmoltz
+ "[http://i068.radikal.ru/1001/79/73237238bee2.jpg]" leads to "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1883230/sg/http://i068.radikal.ru/1001/79/73237238bee2.jpg"
+ markup: [soundcloud 1234]

+ import: fix '<a href="/index.dml?tag=tukhmanov">' to '/tag/tukhmanov'
+ import: re-implement replace_links_with_text_equal_to_href()
+ implement 404 instead "Exception: no article by address soviet-psychedelic-mastaz"

+ admin page: uncategorized tags
+ not handled: [http://www.youtube.com/v/vkUecXJ4Muw?fs=1]

Low priority:
- consider Birman-style shortcuts: Ctrl+Up/Dn
- markup: do not introduce <br> tags within <object>
- rss streams for tags
- typographer: unnecessary nbsp after dash: "AA - BB" => "AA&nbsp;-&nbsp;BB"

- let users to edit their comments for some time (using cookies)
- all comments RSS
- implement archive listing
- ajax comments
- caching of each post and the front page
- fontgen: JS part forms bad request strings for chars like "#$%^"

Archive:
+ html'ed rss fails for safari
+ finish rss handling (usage of html tags there)
+ article 'visitors' breaks layout
+ add href values to the links side bar
+ notify admin about new comments (email)
+ make sure comments are fetched and augmented for a concrete article's page only
