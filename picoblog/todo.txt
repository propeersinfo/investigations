Check list:
* make sure admin links are viewable and accessible for admin only

Critical:
+ html'ed rss fails for safari
+ finish rss handling (usage of html tags there)
+ article 'visitors' breaks layout
+ add href values to the links side bar
+ notify admin about new comments (email)
+ make sure comments are fetched and augmented for a concrete article's page only

Major:
- consider storing main slug in Article objects and additional slugs in a special table of redirects
- cache pre-rendered pages + front page
- '/rss' is incompatible with greader (but it's ok with feedburner)
- find how to copy dev db onto production completely
- implement never-expire resources
- slugs starting with digits interfere with the article-by-id handler
- 'new comment' form, if not filled properly, leads to inappropriate stack trace

Normal:
- introduce a delay accessing the slug maker url
- commenting: add optional e-mail field
- tune up Din support (add variations, particularly)
- import: mixcloud not recognized for http://localhost/ukrainian-groove-part-1

- wrong title imported for http://localhost/20100331-a-href-sovietgroove-blog-show-dml-8737781-syabry-1986-a.html

- new player
- friendly links at the right
- RSS icon
- impl google search
- pagination in comments?

Low priority:
- markup: do not introduce <br> tags within <object>
- rss streams for tags
- typographer: unnecessary nbsp after dash: "AA - BB" => "AA&nbsp;-&nbsp;BB"
- typographer: unnecessary nbsp's: "п/у Яана Кумана. Музыка" -> "п/у&nbsp;Яана&nbsp;Кумана.&nbsp;Музыка"

- bug with youtube images: shot-image is repeated many times: http://127.0.0.1:8080/20090929-k-orbelian-and-armenian-state-orchestra-1974.html
- let users to edit their comments for some time (using cookies)
