Check list:
* make sure admin links are viewable and accessible for admin only

Critical:

Major:
- impl google search
- disallow slugs like "tag", "admin", "page2", "rss"
- '/rss' is incompatible with greader (but it's ok with feedburner)
- consider storing main slug in Article objects and additional slugs in a special table of redirects
- cache pre-rendered pages + front pages + archive
- 'new comment' form, if not filled properly, leads to inappropriate stack trace
+ slugs starting with digits interfere with the article-by-id handler
+ fix "<guid>http://localhost:80/20120209.html</guid>" in RSS
+ http://localhost/1985 not found
+ implement never-expire static resources
+ find how to copy dev db onto production completely

Normal:
- playlist player not working http://localhost/strange-things
- [dewplaylist] not handled: http://localhost/20100330-the-last-portion-of-qaya.html
- introduce a delay accessing the slug maker url
- commenting: add optional e-mail field
- tune up Din support (add variations, particularly)
- use transactions (e.g. saving an article)
- typography: 7" expanded to 7>>
- "Blog posts ← later ... later →" when one page is available

- wrong title imported for http://localhost/20100331-a-href-sovietgroove-blog-show-dml-8737781-syabry-1986-a.html
- keep TagCloud in memcache forever but reset it when a tag changed in datastore
- async e-mail sending
- update memcached tag cloud on article change
+ make dewplayer never expire! +ETag
- let admin distinguish draft articles visually
- copy dewplayer multi onto GAE
- custom mp3 tag: eliminate dirs like "other/gradsky-71âˆ’74-sampler.mp3"
- copy Dropbox images to GAE DB
- new player
- RSS icon
- pagination in comments?
- attribute 'deleted' in Article/Comment
- ajax adding/deleting comments
- make typograhy wester style (tipogriphy?)
+ friendly links at the right
+ import: eliminate "\r\n" in <ul> <ol> <li>
+ import: mixcloud not recognized for http://localhost/ukrainian-groove-part-1
+ soundcloud widgets not imported - http://localhost/a-light-groovy-disco-compilation-by-schmoltz
+ "[http://i068.radikal.ru/1001/79/73237238bee2.jpg]" leads to "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1883230/sg/http://i068.radikal.ru/1001/79/73237238bee2.jpg"
+ markup: [soundcloud 1234]
+ soundcloud objects not imported
+ add 'DinPro' web font support
+ new tags are shown as "None" becasue of new 'title' attribute
+ when a tag is used in new article, the tag cloud is not incremented
+ introduce tag titles

+ lowercase tags
+ import: keep these tags for soundcloud widgets at least (<object> <param> <embed>)

+ image not displayed - [http://i29.fastpic.ru/big/2011/1028/11/96e8a16398add73997e1ee8fef4c4f11.jpg]
+ import: fix '<a href="/index.dml?tag=tukhmanov">' to '/tag/tukhmanov'
+ import: re-implement replace_links_with_text_equal_to_href()
+ implement 404 instead "Exception: no article by address soviet-psychedelic-mastaz"
+ make sure links "<a href>text</a>" are imported correctly; rewrite them to "/slug"
+ admin page: uncategorized tags
+ not handled: [http://www.youtube.com/v/vkUecXJ4Muw?fs=1]
+ navigation with Ctrl+arrows

Low priority:
- consider Birman-style shortcuts: Ctrl+Up/Dn
- markup: do not introduce <br> tags within <object>
- rss streams for tags
- typographer: unnecessary nbsp after dash: "AA - BB" => "AA&nbsp;-&nbsp;BB"
- typographer: unnecessary nbsp's: "п/у Яана Кумана. Музыка" -> "п/у&nbsp;Яана&nbsp;Кумана.&nbsp;Музыка"
- [discogs] tag, easily expanding to some HTML
- bug with youtube images: shot-image is repeated many times: http://127.0.0.1:8080/20090929-k-orbelian-and-armenian-state-orchestra-1974.html
- let users to edit their comments for some time (using cookies)
- all comments RSS
- implement archive listing
- ajax comments
- caching of each post and the front page
- fontgen: JS part forms bad request strings for chars like "#$%^"
- fontgen: imaged h1's: make white space non clickable

Archive:
+ html'ed rss fails for safari
+ finish rss handling (usage of html tags there)
+ article 'visitors' breaks layout
+ add href values to the links side bar
+ notify admin about new comments (email)
+ make sure comments are fetched and augmented for a concrete article's page only
