A quite politicized band — Romantiki / ВИА Романтики — but I very like their arrangment of the song below (written in 1945). Check out its special quiet mood, organ and backing vocals:

Similar band — Iskateli / Искатели — with a psychedelic-mood track talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaspils_concentration_camp">WW2's horrors</a>:
[iskateli - salaspils 197x.mp3]  (1974)

Another version of Salaspils recorded by <a href="/poyushie-gitary-reporter.html">Poyushie Gitary</a>, thanks to <a href="http://www.musicdawn.ru/">Musicdawn</a>!
