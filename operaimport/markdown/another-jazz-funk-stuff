Cool grooves from movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156836/">Ne bolit golova u dyatla</a>. <a href="/tag/krylatov.html">Yevgeni Krylatov</a> is listed there as composer but the music below is hardly written by him. The first clip has 230,000 views!

A <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/pipelinepromotion">DJ Chak</a>'s foreword:
<blockquote class="bbquote">Vladimir Vasilkov did a great job working on this soundtrack with several session musicians. I was hooked up in the mid 80s when i saw this movie on soviet TV. This track is still unrealeased on vinyl, great example of Soviet Jazz-Funk from the early 70s !!! Big up to Mr.Vasilkov and his musicians!</blockquote>
