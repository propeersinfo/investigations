An only groove track from a jazzy LP “В ритме джаза” by Рижский эстрадный оркестр п/у Раймонда Паулса is:

[raimonds pauls - znakomaya melodiya 1970.mp3] 
LP “В ритме джаза” / Мелодия / СМ 02045-6 / 1970

The title could be translated as “A familiar melody”. And that's true! Just compare it to the following composition recorded by swinging jazz band of Iosif Vainshtein (although they are differently titled):

[iosif vainshtein - polet vo vselennuyu 1973.mp3] 
Untitled LP / Мелодия / 33СМ 03841-42 / 1973

These compositions are new to the blog. Also here is another version by the “Современник” orchestra I posted before. Notice, it's titled differently again (:

[sovremennik - ritm idet vpered 1975.mp3]  1975

Two of the tacks are credited to someone called Тед Джонс (Ted Jones?) and one is uncredited but I can't find who is that man with his original composition. Probably it's some jazz standard I'm not competent of.
