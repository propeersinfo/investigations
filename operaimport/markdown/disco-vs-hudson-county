I have <a href="/disco-1978.html">posted</a> the following track (that is a mix of two actually) already, but now I got information its credits noted on the cover — J.Last and S.Wonder — are incorrect.

Really it's a cover on a 1975 recording. I didn't heard about Hudson County before but the track is good and rare also — allmusic.com has no even entry about the author.

Three years difference - how the russians did know about that rare track? Maybe they have heard some James Last's version?
