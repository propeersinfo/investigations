Gennadiy Gladkov has wrote scores for more than 50 movies and is one of my favourite composers. This track is the highest point of his grooviness and I am totally impressed of it. I have edited the dvd's audio so there is no characters' voices anymore. The gem found via Alex Osadchii, a soul/funk dj.
