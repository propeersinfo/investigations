Additionally here goes a track recorded by the 1st formation of the “Eolika” band. (I had posted their exceptional <a href="/eolika-varam-sintezet-visu-bez-riska-1969.html">1969's video</a> already.) This track is extremely rare and has been uploaded by author of  <a href="http://heliplaadistuudio.blogspot.com/">Melodija</a> blog. To my regret he has no wish to upload the rest tracks... there is no much bad in it although. The song is something about girls wearing miniskirts.
