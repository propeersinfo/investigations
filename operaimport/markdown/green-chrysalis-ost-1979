Music from a sci-fi short play movie “Зелёная куколка” based on some Ray Bradburry's prose. I've mixed down a cool piece from there along with The Herbalizer's classics of 1999 because that piece is too short itself. The OST composer is Viacheslav Artiomov / Вячеслав Артёмов; never heard about him before.
