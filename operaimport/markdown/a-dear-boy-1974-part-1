Written by David Tukhmanov and played by ensemble "Vodograi" for movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0422120/">A Dear Boy</a> of 1974. The movie itself is funny and cheerful although is about two boys being kidnapped :)

See a strong track "Life is racing" (I just wonder how the composer has developed that bothered standard rock'n'roll shape):
