Andrey Petrov — a famous soviet composer — has wrote music for many popular movies, but he didn't make groove mainly. The exceptions are listed here:

[andrey petrov - party music 1977.mp3]  (Модный танец) from 1977 movie Служебный роман/An office romance.

[andrey petrov - vokaliz 1979.mp3]  from 1979 movie Осенний марафон/Autumn marathon. The source of the track is unknown.

[andrey petrov - osenny marafon 1979.mp3]  from Осенний марафон/Autumn marathon. I've cut it from a video file because it's arranged differently (and much better) than the well known versions. Not a groove but a great cinematic composition.
