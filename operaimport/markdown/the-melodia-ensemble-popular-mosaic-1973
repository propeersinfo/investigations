Another Melodia's LP full of instrumental covers on famous melodies. Today I'm posting two groovers from there and I will add two more later. Enjoy their hard drum and bass again.

[melodia - let the sunshine in 1973.mp3]  / Солнечный свет

[melodia - aquarius 1973.mp3]  / Водолей

As a bonus here is a famous 1969's original written by Galt MacDermot and played by a sunshine pop band “The 5th Dimension”:
[other/the 5th dimension - aquarius - let the sun shine in 1969.mp3]
