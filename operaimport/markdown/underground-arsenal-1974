Jazz-rock band “Arsenal” plays funk & soul covers. They recorded that being hiding from administration of the recording studio thus they played fast, live and at one take. I'm wondering:
— how clear the musicians plays live,
— how good is the sound quality,
— how cool and English-native Mehrdad Badie sings.

The same time they also recorded almost all songs from Jesus Christ Superstar rock-opera; the whole CD download available: <a href="http://www.megaupload.com/ru/?d=SF6BKMDU">Underground Arsenal</a> / Подпольный Арсенал.
