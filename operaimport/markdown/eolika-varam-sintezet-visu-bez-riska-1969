<a href="/latvian-psychedelic.html">Another</a> latvian group, Eolika (Эолика); it seems Raimonds Pauls has some connection to the band. The song sounds very modern (for that time) and I like it very very much:

They played cool beats in 1969, however their discography starts since 1980 :-( and I've found none beat tracks anymore.

P. S. Google translates the title as "We can synthesize all the risk-free".
