Today is one year this blog started. You could look at <a href="/isaac-shwartz-mr-mckinley-escape-1975.html">the first post</a> made although nowdays I suppose that music wrote Saint Petersburg composer Kalvarsky not Shwartz. Also I bought a <a href="http://sovietgroove.com/">domain</a> but it is empty yet.

Well, let's enjoy an explosive re-edit:

[orera - summertime (dj eln re-edit).mp3] 

And a nice hip-hop remix made by the same man as a bonus:

[other/gorny schit - vasya, vidikhai (dj eln blunted remix).mp3]
