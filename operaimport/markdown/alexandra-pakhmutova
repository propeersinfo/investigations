Alexandra Pakhmutova is a famous soviet composer. She wrote many many “propaganda” songs but there were many nice stuff among it (instrumentals in particular). There are two tracks below and I'll try to upload more cool tracks of her later when find their good quality copies.

[kreis - stary aleks i ostankino 1978.mp3]  1978. Performed by a popular East German band in a disco key; they sings it in Russian with appreciable accent. Yuri Antonov performed the song also — a rare case when the composer performed a song written by someone else.

[golubye gitary - preddorozhnaya 1975.mp3]  1975. This is a bonus. A powerful bonus. I like its tik-tak vocal arrangement.
