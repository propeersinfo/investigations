The Araks/Аракс group recorded that album in 1980 — Bell alarm / Колокол тревоги. It has not be released on vinyl by political reasons; it is a magnetic tape rip. The band had progressive sound among others. The lyrics is philosophical enough. Let's begin with funk-alike and jazz-funk acts respectively:

[araks - you must hurry 1980.mp3]  / Надо спешить

[araks - instrumental 1980.mp3]  / Инструментал

Another two tracks; there is more of pop, but I found them groovie anyway:

[araks - rainbow 1980.mp3]  / Радуга

[araks - the world of dreams and daydreams 1980.mp3]  / Мир снов и грёз

UPD. It seems the downloadable album is the album itself plus bonus tracks; with all tracks ordered differently from the original.
