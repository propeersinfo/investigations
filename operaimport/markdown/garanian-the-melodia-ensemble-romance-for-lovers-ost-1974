The real dirty killer funk from soviet russia! It had been written by Aleksander Gradsky (who would have thought) and played by George Garanian & The Melodia ensemble. The mp3s below are free from film voices and effects, only the original audio. Unbelievable! It's unlikely I will ever dig out something better than this.
