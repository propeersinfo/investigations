Another LP by the Melodia ensemble conducted by George Garanyan. Personally I don't like it much but it is well known among world-wide groove collectors — because of the drum break below. I will be 101th who posted it. The tracks are:

Labirynth / Лабиринт
Marina / Марина
Lenkoran / Ленкорань
Fiery River / Огненная река

P.S. I am shocked — the release is missed from Discogs!
