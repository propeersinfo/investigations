A soulful thing written by Zigmund Lorents, a former member of this latvian band, Eolika.

[eolika - zvezdopad 1980_recode.mp3]  / Звездопад

There is another track on that LP “Dreams of Riga”; hardly a 100% groove, but I like it very much and it would be a nice insertion into an imaginary mix.

[eolika - komu svetit solnze 1980.mp3]  / Кому светит солнце

The LP is made of various styles (e.g. early disco) and is worth to listen to.
