In 1974 Aida Vedisheva has made a cover on classic Francoise Hardy's song "Comment te dire adieu" (1968). The soviet version has turned out to be harder than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iROnyMRJbBQ">original</a>; although there isn't much magic â€” anyone would be harder because of Francoise's softness :-) And that's the reason why the cover is being covered here: listen to the beginning and a piece in the middle.
