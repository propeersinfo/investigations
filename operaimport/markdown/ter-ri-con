A song about a dance called Ter-ri-con. Strong beat enough with large part of rythm rather than melody, with ye-ye mood - all that make the song not usual for that epoque in USSR, probably because music has been written by two french guys :-) The track has been released on a flexible one-side "vinyl" in ~1965 as a part of a series of dance learning recordings. Oh my English.

The lyrics is about a french mademouselle arrived to Moscow. While she used to dance that ter-ri-con there, her french boyfriend has been jealous in his Paris.
