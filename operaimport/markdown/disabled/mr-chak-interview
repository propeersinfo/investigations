On researching a future article on the massive Funk scene in Detroit revolving around the record label "Funknight Records" it appeared that some of their 45's were originally released in Russia. Further research unearthed a very healthy Russian Funk movement based around St.Petersburg and the hard work of a DJ and 45's collector known as Mr.C. I needed to know more...

<b>What's your real name? I've seen you referred to as 'Chakster' too.</b>

Mr Chak is my real name, stage name DJ Chak or Chakster OR Fabulous Mr.C - my full name is Mikhail Chak - friends call me Misha. 

<b>How old are you?</b>

35 years old.

<b>Have you been collecting long?</b>

Buyin' records since 1995-1996 - turned to original 45s since 2004.

<b>Are there many record shops and dealers in Russia specialising in that music?</b>

I don't know any dealers or shops specialised in Soul & Funk Music (US import), but you can find some good Soviet Grooves on 7's and LPs in local secondhand shops and from private dealers. Some East European grooves are also available. New funk stuff available in several DJ shops locally, but they are specialised in electronic music mostly.

Soviet jazz & jazz-funk was cheap in the '90s, some of my friends have been buyin' boxes for nothing. Now you will rarely find any good records, just tons of shit pop music LPs in St.Petersburg. Might be easier in some small towns probably, if you know what are you looking for. Dealers of Soviet stuff sells on Ebay to foreign people who can't even read artist/titles or anything. There's a lot of speculations about it! Sellers upload sound file without artist/titles and the buyer can't Google it to find it cheaper from somebody. Some Soviet records goes for crazy money like that, but all of them pressed on major label Melodiya, normally in 10,000-100,000 copies! How could it be rare then?! The problem is that most Russian people throw away their records. Pirate CDs and then free MP3s filled the market many years ago.

In terms of IMPORT, it simply wasn't impossible: In Soviet days we used to live in a closed country, if you know what I mean? No official vinyl imports from USA to USSR in '50s/'70s and even '80s. It was pretty hard to build collection in this situation in old days unless you've been dealing on illegal black market, it was very dangerous, against the law.

All import we have now at second-hand vinyl stores is mostly trash from Scandinavian second hand market, imported privately by some old dealers for a prices three times as much. Mostly classic rock, heavy metal... some jazz and soul classics - if you're a lucky guy, who never checked real prices online! [laughs] 

<b>Is the Funk and Soul scene just in St.Petersburg or is it spread all over, one would assume that there must be something going on in Moscow?</b>

St.Petersburg definitely is a capitol of Funk & Soul in Russia. I've been playin' deep funk & vintage soul for years and always tried to integrate my events to international soul/funk scene. We booked top DJs/Collectors from UK, Scandinavia, Europe and even USA. I think it's very important to listen to what other DJs playin', and be there to check what's going on at their parties abroad. It was a great experience to play 45s with Ian Wright, Keb Darge, Jazzman Gerald, Fryer, Florian Keller, Andy Smith, Mr Finewine and many others in St.Petersburg. I must say, Keb Darge changed my life in 2004 when we booked him on one of my parties. Since that moment I realised that I missed something in funk and soul. Same year I sold most of my comps (compilations) and reissues to earn more money on original 45s. It was pretty hard for us (Russians) to buy anything on Ebay, it was impossible to use Paypal from here - they changed it later on.

Moscow is probably a capitol of electronic scene in Russia. Most of my international guest DJs never been to Moscow, no one never tried to book them to play in Moscow. My mates from Moscow rather come to St. Petersburg to party with us if someone like Ian Wright was spinnin' here. I'm always Djin' ir other cities in Russia, sometimes it's cool, sometimes not, but at least some Dj/promoters are tryin' to make soul/funk parties to involve more people into this sound of vintage 45s and it works! I actually came up with ideas to build so called "scene" in St.Petersburg. I thought, if not me, then who else?

<b>I'm doing a forthcoming article on "Funknight Records" in Detroit and their amazing scene there. I notice that you have a connection with them. What is it and how did you hook up?</b>

When three years ago I have interviewed DJ Robert Wells (Ann Arbor Soul Club) from Michigan, he told me a story about biggest funk club night in USA. It was very interesting cos most of the funk nights in the world are not so big (200-400 people). He told me Funk Night in Detroit got 1500 people. Later those guys launched FNR label and we've beer chatted with Frank (the mind behind it) from time to time. One year later when I discovered the <a href="http://thesoulsurfers.ru/">Soul Surfers</a> (Russian Funk outfit) we decided to make first Russian deep funk record on FNR and then four others. It was a blast, so many amazing reviews and proper distribution worldwide. Everything sold out pretty quick in USA, Europe and Japan. Now we're working or a new stuff for FNR.

<b>Do you see the scene growing in Russia or is it all revolving around you?</b>

It's hard to say about the whole scene, but I've been DJ'ing a lot in this year, not only in St.Petersburg, but also in Europe and Russia. I think we still build the scene slowly, we work on it. It's still a lot of things to do though.
