I have <a href="http://limonka1.livejournal.com/375797.html">found</a> a vinyl used for puropses of sound system testing. It contains many different styled (all untitled) tracks and one of them is a fine groove.

UPD. Later I found that was cool Polish band <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/No+To+Co">No To Co</a> with their distinctive hard drum-bass style.
