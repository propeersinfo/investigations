1. Find some records little known to the Western audience
2. Cut a whole instrumental piece from a track you like - that gonna be your track now
3. Repeat the last step 6 more times - these gonna be the rest
4. Do not add anything by yourself
5. Release it all as EP [My Troubled Mind] ~> http://www.discogs.com/release/1870616 by The Gaslamp Killer
6. PROFIT!
